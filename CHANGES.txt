0.9.1 (2009-06-12)
==================

- The ``EnvironmentDeleterMiddleware`` (the "closer") middleware did
  not delete the environment key if the application raised an
  exception, potentially causing connection leakage for applications
  that depended upon it doing so.

0.9 (2009-06-09)
================

Features
--------

- Added a ``LoggingCleanup`` implementation which can be passed to
  ``PersistentApplicationFinder``:  it logs counts of loaded and saved
  objects for the connection between the time it is instantiated (i.e.,
  whe the database connection is opened) and the time the connection is
  closed.  See the "Customizing Connection Cleanup" section in the narrative
  docs for notes on using this feature.

- Added ``cleanup`` argument to constructor of ``PersistentApplicationFinder``,
  to allow applications to register a custom cleanup object factory.
  See the "Customizing Connection Cleanup" section in the narrative docs
  for notes on using this feature.

- 100% unit test coverage.

Bug Fixes
---------

- Fixed breakage with ``file:`` URIs having no query string.

0.8 (2009-05-25)
================

Features
--------

Fix a bug in FileStorageURIResolver whereby fully-qualified paths to
Windows files (e.g. ``file://C:\foo\bar\baz?a=1``) were parsed
incorrectly, resulting in a bogus file location.

0.7 (2009-04-23)
================

Features
--------

Added support for multi-databases in PersistentApplicationFinder.
Just pass multiple URIs to the constructor, either as a list of
strings or a single string with URIs separated by whitespace. Each
database must have a distinct database_name. The first URI specifies
the root database.

0.6 (2008-01-06)
================

Backwards Incompatibilities
----------------------------

``dbfactory_from_uri`` now returns only a single argument (the
factory).

Features
--------

Docs updated with argument values for ``file://`` and ``zeo://`` URI
schemes; this file converted to real REST.

0.5 (unknown)
=============

Pass ``layout`` to BlobStorage as a kwarg explicitly (for forward
compatibility).

Depend on ZODB3 3.8.1+.

0.4 (unknown)
=============

Add ``connection_cache_size``, ``connection_pool_size``, and
``database_name`` arguments to both FileStorage and ClientStorage URI
resolver schemes.  ``connection_cache_size`` represents the ZODB
object cache size (the ``cache_size`` parameter to the DB
constructor), ``connection_pool_size`` represents the ZODB connection
pool size (the ``pool_size`` parameter to the DB constructor), and
``database_name`` represents the ZODB database name (the
``database_name`` parameter to the DB constructor).
``connection_cache_size`` defaults to 10000 (overriding the too-low DB
constructor default of 400), ``connection_pool_size`` defaults to 7,
and ``database_name`` defaults to ``unnamed``.

0.3 (unknown)
=============

Add 'egg:repoze.zodbconn#closer' middleware.

Add blobstorage and demostorage support to zeo and file resolvers.

0.2 (unknown)
=============

Unknown changes

0.1 (unknown)
=============

Initial release.
